# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for Bioinformatics

This repository shows how to use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) public cloud services to scale sets of **bioinformatics data analysis** tasks. This Repo uses cloud best practices for GCP.  All examples use **genomic** sample (input) data, tools and pipelines.  Use cases included here as examples are called by any and all of the following terms:
- genomic-scale data workflows or pipelines
- bioinformatics primary, secondary or tertiary analysis 
- distributed cloud-based batch jobs

### Why would I choose to use a public cloud vendor for bioinformatics?

⭐️ **SAVE MONEY** run (and pay for) scalable analysis jobs only when you need to run them  
⭐️ **SAVE TIME** use vendor-managed infrastructure & best-practice patterns for fast repeatable research
