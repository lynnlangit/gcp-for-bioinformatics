# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for Bioinformatics

This repository shows how to use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) public cloud services to scale sets of **bioinformatics data analysis** tasks. This Repo uses cloud best practices for GCP.  All examples use **genomic** sample (input) data, tools and pipelines.  Use cases included here as examples are called by any and all of the following terms:
- genomic-scale data workflows or pipelines
- bioinformatics primary, secondary or tertiary analysis 
- distributed cloud-based batch jobs

### Why would I choose to use a public cloud vendor for bioinformatics?

⭐️ **SAVE MONEY** run (and pay for) scalable analysis jobs only when you need to run them  
⭐️ **SAVE TIME** use vendor-managed infrastructure & best-practice patterns for fast repeatable research   
📗 **READ** the [FAQ for GCP bioinformatics](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-for-bioinformatics/blob/master/1_FAQ.md) for this Repo  
📕 **READ** Nature article: ["Cloud computing for genomic data analysis and collaboration"](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.113)  
📗 **READ** the top 4 most [common use cases](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-for-bioinformatics/blob/master/3_USER-STORIES.md) for using the public cloud for bioinformatics researchers
