# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for Bioinformatics

This repository shows how to use ☁️ Google Cloud Platform public cloud services to scale **bioinformatics data analysis** tasks using cloud best practices for GCP.  This use cases featured as exampled are called any and all of the following: genomic-scale data workflows, pipelines, analysis or batch jobs.

### Why would I choose to use a public cloud vendor for bioinformatics?


⭐️ **SAVE MONEY** run (and pay for) scalable analysis jobs only when you need to run them  
⭐️ **SAVE TIME** use vendor-managed infrastructure & best-practice patterns for fast repeatable research
