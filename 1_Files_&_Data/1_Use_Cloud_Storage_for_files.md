# Use Google Cloud File Storage


### When to use Google Cloud File Storage?
 - When your workload and data files are too big to run on your laptop
 - When you don't want to wait for time on your organization's shared cluster


### Intro
  Google Cloud Platform Cloud Storage is an online file storage webservice for storing, accessing and transferring data on the Google Cloud platform. 
  
  GCP Cloud storage is the ideal location for input and output files when performing analysis (GCP Compute services) and workflows.

  Files are organized in buckets. Think of buckets as basically folders in the root of the storage directory of your project. Buckets must have a globally unique name and subsequent foldeers in buckets are called folders and not buckets.  Below are a couple of considerations to have in mind when creating a bucket


### Key considerations
 - Understand costs and selecting the best fit type of storage for your data [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations)
 - Understand storage class types (multi-regional, regional, nearline, coldline) [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes)
 - Understand storage location options (shown below) or [here](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations)

### How to do this
 - CREATE a bucket with a unique name
 - CONFIGURE the bucket storage class type (see below)
 - CONFIGURE the bucket location 
 - CONFIGURE the bucket access control, encryption & retention

### How to verify you've done it
 - UPLOAD file(s) to the bucket using the web console or the 'gsutil' tool - [link](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) - example shown below

### Other Things to Know
 - Storage can be the most significant GCP service cost for bioinformatics (due to the number and size of files involved in analysis) so be careful to select the storage class that fits your analysis best i.e. multi-regional, regional.... so as not to pay for unused resources
 - Design file archiving processes, i.e. move to nearline or coldline if not accessing or over time (i.e. monthly...)
 - Delete files generated during processing (often called intermediate files) that are no longer needed when jobs complete
