# Use Public Reference Datasets

### Intro
- Google Cloud Genomics provides a variety of public datasets that you can access for free and integrate into your research jobs
    - An example is the 1000 Genomes dataset - [link](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/docs/public-datasets/1000-genomes)
    - Google hosts these datasets and proves public access to the data via as BigQuery datasets or Cloud Storage buckets.

### Why do this
 - USE a reference file in cloud-based analysis
 - SAVE time by using a reference file that is already available in the cloud (no need to upload)

### Key considerations
 - Google adds more reference files as they become available

### How to do this
 - Interactive access is available in the BigQuery console. You can explore variant calls in case/control & cohort analysis. There are sample queries to help you get started. [GO TO CLOUD GENOMICS DATASETS IN BIGQUERY](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/project/genomics-public-data)

 - File access is available from Cloud Storage. Files are available in BAM, VCF, or FASTA formats. 
 - To access these public files, you can use a number of GCP services (such as Compute Engine VMs), or tools such as Terra.bio from The Broad or others.
    - Go to the [public REFERENCE Files](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/genomics-public-data/) cloud storage bucket
    - Go to the [public ANNOTATION Files](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/gcs-public-data--genomics/human-variant-annotation) cloud storage bucket

### How to verify you've done it
 - REFERENCE the file in a BigQuery query or a VM-based analysis
