# Use Nextflow for Pipelines

### Why do this
 USE the Nextflow pipeline language to define and run your analysis workflow at scale 

### What is this
 Nextflow is a reactive workflow framework & DSL for writing data-intensive computational pipelines.  Run jobs on a single GCE Virtual Machine or a cluster of VMs. You can use GCE + Pipelines API (PAPI) using docker images on VMs as well.
 - Nextflow can run on GCP or many other providers
 - Nextflow can run on GCP in two ways:
   - Run jobs on Compute Engine VMs (can run bioinformatics tools from Docker)
   - Run jobs on Compute Engine VMS using the **& Life Sciences (Genomics Pipelines) API**

### Key considerations
- Understand core Nextflow features - [link](https://www.nextflow.io/index.html#Features)

### How to do this
 - SETUP prereqs for Nextflow on your VM - JDK, Docker, Graphviz(optional)
 - RUN RNAseq example pipeline on Compute Engine and Cloud Storage - [link](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/docs/tutorials/nextflow)
 - RUN VariantCalling pipeline w/GATK - [link](https://github.com/CRG-CNAG/CalliNGS-NF/)

### How to verify you've done it
 - VERIFY using a short example script - [link](https://gist.github.com/lynnlangit/c1ed2a3535b3ae6711dd14687d5174c3)
 - VERIFY the output files from the examples above
 - REVIEW Nextflow examples which produce files in a `results` folder

### Other Things to Know
 - RUN short example using Nextflow and the `blastn` tool, running in Docker on a custom GCE VM image - [link](https://medium.com/@lynnlangit/cloud-native-hello-world-for-bioinformatics-7831aecc8d1a)
 - USE Nextflow pipelines with other cloud vendors: AWS - [link](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/awscloud.html)
 - FIND and run example Nextflow bioinformatics pipelines (such as one for 'rnaseq jobs') at the `nf-core` site - [link](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/docs)
 - MONITOR running Nextflow pipelines using the visual `Nextflow Tower` tool - [link](https://tower.nf/)
 - REGISTER Nextflow workflows for distribution and reuse in the [Dockstore](https://docs.dockstore.org/docs/prereqs/getting-started-with-nextflow/) genomics workflow registry
    - Note that Nextflow (NF) on Dockstore is a bit different from CWL or WDL. 
    - Instead of having one workflow descriptor file, Nextflow with Dockstore uses two different kinds of files: A config file, `nextflow.config` and a descriptor file, generally called, `main.nf`.
