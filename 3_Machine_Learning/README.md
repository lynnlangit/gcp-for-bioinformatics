# Use Google Cloud Services for Machine Learning


In this section, you'll get information about using Google Cloud services for machine learning.  You'll use BigQuery Machine Learning.  Also you'll use Google ML APIs and services.  Additionally you'll use Google Colabs to run BigQuery ML jobs in a Jupyter notebook.

Here are the topic pages in this section:

- Use AutoML for Vision to analyze photos and videos
Use AutoML for Text to analyze text and natural language
- Use AutoML Tables to analyze tabular data
- Use DeepVariant to perform variant analysis
- Use Deep Learning VM image to create your own ML model 
- Use Deep Learning container image to create your own ML model/container
- Use Jupyter notebook with BigQuery API
- Use Jupyter notebook with BigQuery and BQ ML APIs

NOTE: Right click on the 'Open in Colab' button at the top of the *.ipynb (IPython notebook file) and 'open link in a new tab' as directly opening this link is blocked in GitHub.

### For More Information

I created an entire course on LinkedIn Learning on GCP Machine Learning.  Also I published a GitHub Repo with code samples for GCP Machine Learning services - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-ml) for more advanced machine learning scenarios.
