# Setup your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account

### Why setup google cloud compute?
 - Your workload is too big to run on your laptop
 - You don't want to wait for compute time on your organization's shared compute cluster
 - You want to use Google Cloud Platform services to run large (or huge) genomic analysis jobs

### What you'll gain from this lesson?
 - The ability to perform analysis (or compute) on files (and other types of data) at a large or varying scale without worrying about system configuration changes
 - Preparation for running analysis on public cloud services hosted by GCP

### Key considerations
 - GCP Account types:  
      - **Use GCP Free Tier** (get $ 300 USD in GCP credits for new users) minimal service limits set by Google - [here](https://cloud.google.com/free) --OR--
    - **Use Your Organization's GCP Account** - service limits set by your company & Google
 - Understand the size & complexity of your analysis  
 - Review your budget / timeline  
 - Determine the best location (Google data center) for your project - [GCP data center locations](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/) shown below

 NOTE: There are many bioinformatics analysis workflow tools, libraries & solutions which can be run on top of core GCP services.  Examples include [Terra.bio (was Firecloud)](https://terra.bio/), [cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Nextflow.io](https://www.nextflow.io/) and many others.

### How to do get started?
 - REQUEST an account
   - a) a GCP account from your organization --OR--
   - b) set up a GCP new (FREE Tier) account [here](https://cloud.google.com/free) 
 - CREATE your GCP PROJECT - Think of them as a folders where project resources will are organized
   - USE **each** GCP Project as a container for **each** of your research projects
   - As a best practice, CREATE separate GCP projects for different workflows. This allows you to more easily manage security, service costs and other settings in the project. You could group resources by grant for example. 
 - ADD GCP service instances to your GCP Project 
    - Add services by data center location and GCP project name.
    - Add a Virtual Machine instance & a Cloud Storage bucket which are located.
      - in the Google datacenter in `us-east` --AND--
      - in your GCP Project named `my-research-project`

### How to verify you've done it
 - LOGIN to [GCP console](http://console.cloud.google.com) or Web UI
 - VIEW your account login (upper right of console)
 - VIEW your project name, shown as 'gcp-for-bioinformatics' below

### Other Things to Know
  - GCP FREE tier account have built-in service [usage limits](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier)
 - For FREE Tier, after you've spent your $300, GCP service costs are billed to **YOU** (via the credit information provided on account creation)
 - GCP service costs are billed to **YOUR COMPANY**  (or research group) for Organizational Accounts
 - SET UP a **GCP Budget** to get notified when GCP services exceed a service cost limit you set (this is useful for testing accounts) [more info here](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets)
 - REVIEW GCP Billing Accounts & Resources Hierachy (shown below)
    - A billing account can be linked to one or more GCP projects and the billing account specifies how you pay (credit card, invoice...) for GCP services
   - A billing account is linked to a payment profile (individual or corporate)
