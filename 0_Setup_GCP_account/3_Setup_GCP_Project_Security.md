# Setup GCP Project Security


### Objective
 - Learn how to secure your analysis data
 - Learn how to secure your GCP project resources

### Intro
 - Google Cloud provides  uses IAM (Identity and Access Management) objects to allow you to configure security
 - GCP makes services available as either services, APIs or services which include APIs

### Key considerations
 - Only enable services/APIs that you are using in your GCP Project
 - Consider auditing service usage by using Stackdriver logs - [link](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/exporting-stackdriver-logging-for-security-and-access-analytics)

### How to do this
 - Associate GCP IAM User accounts to GCP Roles (BigQuery User role shown below)
 - Best Practice: Use GCP-created roles.  Service-level roles include individual service permissions
 - You can create custom IAM (or security) roles if needed

### How to verify you've done it
 - Test permissions assigned to roles/users

### Other Things to Know
 - Data is encrypted by default in Cloud Storage using a Google-provided encryption key.  It is possible for you to supply your own encryption key when your requirements necessitate this.
 - You can use GCP service object labels to help you to indentify services instances that have different security requirements.  They are implemented as key:value tag pairs, i.e. `"lab":"langit-lab"` etc...
